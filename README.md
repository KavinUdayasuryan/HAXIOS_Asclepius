### This project focuses on Implementation of **Edge AI for Healthcare**.
#### The problem statement we are working on focusues on helping elders in critical time. The developed model sends a SOS when a particular keyword **HELP** is detected.

>*)Edge Impulse platform is used for data acquisition from arduino nano 33 BLE.<br />
>*)The model is trained on ~100 dataset with two labels - **Noise and Help** to help discard random noise.<br />
>*)MFCC and MFC classifiers are used in processing the audio data and Keras is used for classification.
